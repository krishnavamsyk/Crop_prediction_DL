# Crop_prediction_DL


Our project leverages machine learning to predict crop diseases, helping farmers make proactive decisions to protect their yields. By analyzing data from sources such as crop images and weather forecasts, our model identifies patterns that indicate potential disease outbreaks. This early detection enables timely intervention, reducing crop losses and promoting sustainable agriculture. Our solution integrates with easy-to-use platforms, providing farmers with actionable insights to enhance crop health and productivity.

About Crop Recommendation System:
Our crop recommendation system uses machine learning to suggest the best crops for farmers to grow based on soil properties, climate conditions. By analyzing these factors, the system helps farmers choose crops that are most likely to thrive in their specific conditions, optimizing yield potential, resource usage, and overall farm productivity. This technology supports sustainable agriculture by aligning crop choices with environmental suitability.

About Fertilizer Recommendation System:
Our fertilizer recommendation system uses machine learning to suggest optimal fertilizer types and quantities based on crop type, soil composition, and environmental conditions. By analyzing these factors, the system provides tailored recommendations that improve crop health and maximize yield, while minimizing waste and environmental impact. This approach promotes efficient nutrient management, supporting sustainable farming practices.

About Weather Forecasting System:
Our weather forecasting system uses advanced machine learning algorithms to predict weather patterns and conditions that affect crop growth. By real-time observations, and climate models, it provides accurate forecasts for temperature, rainfall, humidity, and other key factors. These predictions help farmers make informed decisions on planting, irrigation, and pest management, ultimately optimizing crop yield and reducing risks from adverse weather events.

Tools and Technology used:
1.Frontend -->Streamlit

2.Backend -->Machine Learning models and algorithms

3.Machine models and algorithms -->CNN, SVM, Naive-Bayes, YOLO, Transfer Learning.

How we did?
We used CNN architecture for crop disease prediction for various plants, along with that we used transfer learning for betterment for our model and finally applied YOLO to reach the peak form. Naive-Bayes and SVM were used in predicting crop recommender and fertilizer recommender respectively.

What we did in front-end?

->Crop-Disease Predictor

->Weather forecast and location detector

->Crop-Recommender

->Fertilizer-Recommender
